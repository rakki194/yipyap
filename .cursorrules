The frontend is a solidjs application, not a react one! Use solidjs syntax and features.
The backend is Python using FastAPI.
Try to keep the same naming conventions as the original implementation when sensible and try to reuse as much code as possible, this applies to CSS too! Always take into account the base style rules in the src/styles.css file.
Theme specific styles are in the src/themes.css file.
There is no `App.tsx` file, do not create it, the root component is in the src/main.tsx file, src/contexts/app.tsx is the app context which is the global state of the app.
Think step-by-step and write code that is easy to understand and maintain.
The translations are in the src/i18n folder, all language files must follow the type definitions in src/i18n/types.ts. The list of supported languages and locale types are defined in src/i18n/index.ts. New languages must be added to both the languages array and the Locale type.
If you are refactoring the code, make sure to update the documentation and comments to reflect the changes and also update the .cursorrules accordingly.
